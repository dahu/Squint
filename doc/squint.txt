 1. INTRODUCTION                                            *squint-intro*

Squint lets you focus on important work without distractions by zooming in on
the current function or visual selection.

Command Line~

Use `:[range]Squint` to zoom in on a range of lines.
By default, the range is the current line.
This supports visual line ranges with the |'<|,|'>| marks.

Normal Mode Commands~

Use `<leader>z` to zoom the current |[[| to |][| range or visual selection.
If you want to map this differently, use `<plug>squint_zoom_in`

Use `<leader>Z` to zoom back out again.
If you want to map this differently, use `<plug>squint_zoom_out`

<plug>squint_zoom_in~

The normal mode `<plug>squint_zoom_in` can be mapped to suit the logical
default chunk of your current filetype. By default, this uses the range
bounded by |[[| , |][| which is the current function in C (and through
filetype plugins, many other languages too). In |vim-asciidoc| for instance,
this is the current Heading-bounded section. If you don't want |[[| ,|][| to
be your default chunk range then nmap `<plug>squint_zoom_in` to operate on the
desired range.

Consider, for example, the arguably improbable desire to be able to zoom in on
a range that is 10 lines around the cursor. Adding the following map to your
|$MYVIMRC| will accomplish that:
>
  nmap <plug>squint_zoom_in :-10,+10 Squint\|norm! 51%<cr>
<

 2. VIMOUTLINER SUPPORT                               *squint-vimoutliner*

Unlike the built-in hoisting plugin for Vimoutliner, Squint allows hoisting
from within hoists.

Use `<localleader>h` to hoist the current subtopics.
Use `<localleader>Z` to de-hoist the current buffer back into its source.

NOTE:	Vim's default <localleader> is `\`
	Vimoutliner's default recommended <localleader> is `,,`
        To see your current <localleader>, type >
          :echo maplocalleader
<

If you don't want to use <localleader>h and <localleader>Z for the hoist and
de-hoist operations, they can be configured through `<plug>squint_votl_hoist`
and `<plug>squint_votl_dehoist` respectively.

==============================================================================
 3. CONFIGURATION                                   *squint-configuration*

|'squint_dir'|		Directory in which to store all squint tempfiles.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            *'squint_dir'*
Value:   string                                                          ~
Default: unset                                                           ~

By default, Squint saves tempfiles in the same directory as the file from
which you zoomed. If you want to store all of your squints in one directory
(for easy cleanup, say), add a line like this to your |$MYVIMRC|
>
  let g:squint_dir = '~/.vim/squint/'
<
