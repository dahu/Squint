__Tired of squinting to keep your focus?__

TIP: If you like Squint and want to share the W00t!, I'm grateful for

Use `<leader>z` to zoom the current `[[` to `][` range or visual
selection into a new scratch buffer of the same `&filetype` as the
current buffer.

Use `<leader>Z` to zoom the current buffer contents back out into the
original buffer.

The `<leader>z` trigger is configurable through `<plug>squint_zoom_in`.
